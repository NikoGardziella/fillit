# fillit
Hive group project after get_next_line. The purpose is to make the smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes) with a given list of tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from the top left.
Compiling

Run make, an executable called fillit should compile directly. Please submit an issue if you run into any.
